# Project Brief – Lawsons CloudWorks Website

You are building the marketing website for **Lawsons CloudWorks**, a specialist tech consultancy brand.

---

## 1. Business Context

**Lawsons CloudWorks** is a **trading name of Lawsons Enterprises Ltd**, a UK company that also owns:

- **Lawsons Creative** – web design/creative agency for SMEs
- **Lawsons Studio / FORM ATHLETIC** – apparel and merch brands
- Several internal products (fitness app, takeaway platform, etc.)

CloudWorks is the **tech consultancy arm**:

- Focus: **cloud, workspaces, modern endpoint, and automation**.
- Audience: **small and mid-sized organisations** who need enterprise-level thinking without huge-consultancy noise or cost.
- Delivery model: principal consultant (Andy) plus a network of specialists/partners.

The site should feel like a **small, sharp consultancy**, not a lone freelancer and not a generic MSP.

---

## 2. Core Positioning

Use this as the conceptual positioning (you will write your own polished copy based on it):

> **Lawsons CloudWorks** helps small and mid-sized teams design, deploy, and improve their **cloud, workspace, and automation** environments – bringing enterprise experience (e.g. AWS WorkSpaces at 4,000-seat scale) to organisations that can’t or don’t want to hire a big consultancy.

Key ideas:

- Modern workplace + cloud + automation
- Pragmatic, plain-English consulting
- Deep hands-on experience (not just slideware)
- Tightly scoped, outcome-focused engagements

---

## 3. Target Audience

Design and content should speak primarily to:

1. **SMB leaders and directors**  
   - MDs, Ops Directors, IT Managers at 20–300 person organisations.
   - Pain: legacy on-prem, messy hybrid, poor remote experience, security worries.

2. **Tech-adjacent decision makers**  
   - People who “own” tech decisions but aren’t deep technical (Heads of Ops, HR, Finance).
   - Need things explained clearly and linked to business outcomes.

3. **Existing Lawsons Creative clients**  
   - Some will graduate from “new website” problems into “our IT and cloud estate is a mess”.
   - CloudWorks should feel like the “grown-up infra cousin” of Lawsons Creative.

---

## 4. Tone & Voice

- UK English throughout.
- Professional and confident, but **approachable and human**.
- Avoid buzzword soup. Explain concepts plainly.
- Emphasise outcomes and clarity, not hype.
- No “we’re ninjas/rockstars” language.

Think: **Intelliworx / modern workplace consultancies**, but more direct, less corporate fluff.  [oai_citation:1‡Intelliworx](https://intelliworx.co/uk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

---

## 5. Information Architecture (Pages)

MVP site should include:

1. **Home**
2. **Services**
   - Either one page with clear sections, or sub-anchors for:
     - Cloud & Workspace Architecture
     - Modern Endpoint & Identity
     - Automation & Dev Tooling
     - Advisory & Project Rescue
3. **Approach**
4. **Case Studies** (initially 1–2 “coming soon” placeholders, but structured properly)
5. **About**
6. **Contact**
7. **Legal / Footer content**
   - Including “Lawsons CloudWorks is a trading name of Lawsons Enterprises Ltd”

---

## 6. Page-by-Page Requirements

### 6.1 Home

**Goals:**

- Immediately explain **what CloudWorks is** and **who it’s for**.
- Give a simple, credible reason to get in touch.
- Encourage deeper exploration of Services and Approach.

**Hero section:**

- Clear headline that states value, e.g. conceptually:
  - “Cloud, workspaces and automation for teams who need enterprise thinking without enterprise drama.”
- Subheading: one short paragraph that:
  - Mentions **cloud / modern workplace / automation**
  - Name-drops relevant experience (e.g. AWS WorkSpaces at scale, Microsoft stack).
- Primary CTA button:
  - e.g. “Book a discovery call” or “Request a technical review”.
- Secondary CTA:
  - Link to Services or Approach.

**Below the fold:**

1. **Service pillars overview**
   - 3–4 cards/blocks summarising:
     - Cloud & Workspace Architecture
     - Modern Endpoint & Identity
     - Automation & Dev Tooling
     - Advisory & Project Rescue
   - Each with 1–2 line description and link/anchor into Services page.

2. **Outcomes section**
   - “What we help you achieve” in business language:
     - Example outcomes: smoother remote work, fewer support fires, better security posture, clearer roadmap.

3. **Credibility strip**
   - Short bullets like:
     - “30+ years in IT”
     - “Experience running AWS WorkSpaces for 4,000+ developers”
     - “Microsoft and AWS ecosystems”
   - Subtle reference to being part of Lawsons Enterprises, not a random one-man band.

4. **Teaser for Case Studies**
   - Structured area that will later hold case studies.
   - For now, allow for:
     - 1 featured “coming soon” with the **type** of engagement, not fake logos.

5. **CTA band near the bottom**
   - Reinforce one key action, e.g. “Let’s untangle your cloud and workspace” with a button to Contact.

### 6.2 Services

**Goal:** Turn “we do tech stuff” into a small, clear set of offers.

Layout: Top intro + clearly separated sections per pillar.

#### Intro

- Short paragraph positioning CloudWorks as **consulting and delivery** rather than generic managed services.
- Emphasise:
  - Cloud & workspace design
  - Modern endpoint & identity
  - Automation & Dev tooling
  - Advisory/project rescue

#### Pillar 1: Cloud & Workspace Architecture

- Problems we solve (bullets), e.g.:
  - Legacy on-prem / VPN-heavy setups
  - Slow, unreliable remote access
  - Confusing mix of cloud providers and tools
- Services (examples; you can phrase better):
  - Cloud strategy and architecture review
  - AWS (incl. WorkSpaces) and Microsoft 365 / Azure designs
  - Hybrid environment design (office + remote)
- Outcomes:
  - Faster, more reliable access for users
  - Clear diagrams and documentation
  - Predictable running costs

#### Pillar 2: Modern Endpoint & Identity

- Problems:
  - Manually built laptops, inconsistent builds
  - Weak or inconsistent security policies
  - Painful onboarding/offboarding
- Services:
  - Endpoint management strategy (Intune/other)
  - Identity & access patterns (SSO, conditional access)
  - Baseline security and patching approach
- Outcomes:
  - Faster device rollout
  - Stronger security without annoying users
  - Documented “how we do it here”

#### Pillar 3: Automation & Dev Tooling

- Problems:
  - Manual, repetitive tasks
  - Poor GitHub / CI/CD practices
  - Ad hoc scripts with no ownership
- Services:
  - GitHub pipelines and workflows
  - Automation between systems (e.g. Notion ↔ Xero via no/low-code automators)
  - Infrastructure-as-code and environment automation (high level)
- Outcomes:
  - Fewer manual steps, fewer errors
  - Faster delivery of changes
  - Clear ownership and documentation

#### Pillar 4: Advisory & Project Rescue

- Problems:
  - “We’ve started a project and it’s going sideways.”
  - “We think our setup is fragile but aren’t sure where to start.”
- Services:
  - Architecture / health checks
  - Second opinions on vendor proposals
  - Roadmapping and prioritisation
- Outcomes:
  - Clear prioritised actions
  - Independent view, documented recommendations
  - Better chance of projects landing well

For each pillar, make sure there is a **clear CTA** (e.g. “Discuss this with us”) that points to Contact.

### 6.3 Approach

**Goal:** Explain *how* CloudWorks works with clients, to differentiate from standard “MSP” support pages. Take cues from modern workplace consultancies that spell out process and advisory style.  [oai_citation:2‡SR Cloud Solutions](https://srcloudsolutions.co.uk/modern-workplace/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

Sections to include:

1. **How we engage**
   - Typical flow in 3–5 steps, e.g.:
     1. Discovery call
     2. Short diagnostic (could be remote)
     3. Proposal / options
     4. Delivery and check-ins
     5. Handover and optional ongoing support

2. **Small consultancy, big experience**
   - Be transparent that:
     - CloudWorks is led by an experienced principal consultant.
     - For specialised work, partners/contractors may be brought in.
   - Emphasise that everything is still **owned and coordinated by CloudWorks**.

3. **Documentation and handover**
   - Stress that the output isn’t just “done work”, but also:
     - Diagrams
     - Written summaries in human language
     - Clear next steps
   - This sets CloudWorks apart from “mystery meat” IT support.

4. **Who we work best with**
   - Bullet profile of ideal clients:
     - Teams willing to invest some time and attention
     - People open to honest conversations about trade-offs
     - Businesses that value clarity and documentation

---

### 6.4 Case Studies

**Goal:** Provide a structure for real case studies (even if initially only one or two are available).

Create a **Case Studies** index page with:

- Short intro: explaining that CloudWorks engagements are often sensitive, so details are anonymised where necessary.
- Card layout for case studies:
  - Title (e.g. “Modernising a remote dev environment for a 200-person software company”)
  - Industry / size
  - The main problem
  - Key outcomes

Each case study detail page should follow a standard structure:

1. **Client & context**
2. **The challenge**
3. **What we did**
4. **Outcomes and metrics** (where allowed)
5. **What happens next / ongoing work (if relevant)**

For MVP, you can create 1–2 placeholder case studies with clearly labelled dummy content so they can be replaced later, but **do not invent fake logos or names**; keep it generic/anonymised.

---

### 6.5 About

**Goal:** Make the business feel credible and human without oversharing.

Sections:

1. **Who we are**
   - Lawsons CloudWorks as a brand under **Lawsons Enterprises Ltd**.
   - One short paragraph on Lawsons Enterprises and mention Lawsons Creative as a sibling brand.

2. **Principal Consultant**
   - Brief micro-bio for Andy:
     - Career in IT since mid-90s
     - Experience running AWS WorkSpaces for ~4,000 devs
     - Background in Microsoft stack and modern workplace / cloud.
   - Emphasise mix of strategic and hands-on experience.

3. **Our values**
   - Examples:
     - Clarity over jargon
     - Honest trade-offs and realistic scopes
     - Documentation and knowledge transfer
     - Helping clients become **less** dependent, not more.

4. **Legal line**
   - A clear sentence:
     - “Lawsons CloudWorks is a trading name of Lawsons Enterprises Ltd, a company registered in [jurisdiction – UK]”.

---

### 6.6 Contact

**Goal:** Make it dead simple to get in touch while gathering enough context to make first contact useful.

Include:

- Short intro line reassuring they’re not entering a spam funnel.
- Contact form with fields like:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Company name
  - Role
  - Rough company size (drop-down bands)
  - What do you need help with? (multi-select aligned to service pillars)
  - How urgent is this? (drop-down)
  - Free-text message
- Optional:
  - “Attach supporting documents” placeholder if technically feasible later.

On submission:

- Show a clear confirmation message:
  - Confirm that the message has been received.
  - Set an expectation for reply time (e.g. “We usually reply within one business day.”)

Also include:

- Direct email address (e.g. a CloudWorks-specific address if provided).
- No phone number is required unless explicitly supplied separately.

---

## 7. Navigation & Layout Requirements

- **Top navigation**:
  - Logo / brand name: “Lawsons CloudWorks”
  - Menu items: Home, Services, Approach, Case Studies, About, Contact
- **Footer**:
  - Short description of CloudWorks
  - Legal text about trading name and Lawsons Enterprises Ltd
  - Link to Lawsons Creative
  - Copyright notice with year

Design notes:

- Clean, modern layout. No heavy animation.
- Responsive: works well on phones, tablets, and desktops.
- Keep visual language compatible with a future “Lawsons Group” feel – i.e. not wildly different from what a modern, minimal tech consultancy would use.

---

## 8. SEO & Content Guidelines

- Use **UK spelling** (optimise, organisation, etc.).
- Create clear H1 and H2 structures per page.
- Page titles and meta descriptions should:
  - Mention “cloud consulting”, “modern workplace”, “cloud workspace”, and similar logical phrases where appropriate.
  - Include “Lawsons CloudWorks” and “UK” where relevant.
- Make copy scannable:
  - Short paragraphs
  - Bullet lists for problem/solution sections
- Include FAQ-style content on the **Services** or **Approach** page, inspired by cloud consulting FAQs on sites like Intelliworx and modern workplace partners.  [oai_citation:3‡Intelliworx](https://intelliworx.co/uk/cloud-consulting/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

---

## 9. Accessibility & UX

- Proper HTML semantics: headings in order, landmarks (header/nav/main/footer).
- Sufficient colour contrast.
- Clear focus styles for interactive elements.
- Links and buttons have meaningful labels (no “Click here” as the only text).
- Form errors are clearly highlighted with helpful messages.

---

## 10. Technical / Implementation Notes

- The actual implementation stack is up to you, but assume:
  - This will be a **static or JAMstack-style site** deployed via GitHub → Vercel or similar.
  - Keep dependencies light; avoid huge front-end frameworks unless absolutely necessary.
- Structure code and content in a way that makes it easy to:
  - Add new case studies
  - Extend Services with sub-pages if needed
  - Add a blog/resources section later without redesigning everything

---

## 11. Future Expansion Hooks

Design the site so it’s easy to add later:

- A **Resources / Insights** section (articles, checklists, guides).
- More detailed service sub-pages (e.g. “AWS WorkSpaces consulting”, “Modern Endpoint with Intune”).
- More case studies.

For now, create **navigation and layout that won’t break** when those are added.

---

## What Success Looks Like

By the end of this project, we should have:

- A complete, production-ready marketing site for **Lawsons CloudWorks**.
- Clear, structured content that:
  - Explains who CloudWorks is
  - Explains what it sells
  - Demonstrates credibility
  - Makes it easy to get in touch
- A site that looks and feels like a **serious, modern, small consultancy**, and that fits naturally into the broader **Lawsons Enterprises Ltd** ecosystem.
